Yesterday night I couldn't sleep, and ended up listening to an episode of the Joe Rogan podcast with a guy called [David Goggins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tSTk1083VY). Motivational LA stuff. He likes to shout "STAY HARD!" a lot. 

I took a long time to get to sleep.

When I woke up I was super hungry and pretty tired, but some of Goggins' motivation stuck with me. He's super big on never ever quitting. I've been putting off going for my first run in ages for a few days.

It was gorgeous out. Crisp and foggy, lit up by sunshine that hadn't quite emerged. I got up and walked out and promised I'd run for 30 minutes without stopping. 

And the first 5 minutes were kind of hard, but the next 25 breezed past. And as I hit 30 I changed to a walk and all the endorphins hit me like a drug. It was the best I've felt in ages.

Now I'm alive instead of daydreaming. On a morning when I had all my usual reasons to cosy up and watch TV, or something equally potato-y. I didn't sleep great, but I feel fine. I didn't eat till 11, but it didn't affect me.

Perhaps all that motivational crap isn't crap at all.
