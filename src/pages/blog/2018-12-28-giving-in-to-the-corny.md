I've given in to watching motivational YouTube videos and listening to motivational podcasts.

For ages I resisted as they're so damn corny, but they work.

Faves:
- Anything by David Goggins
- Tara Brach
- Alan Watts

I've also been thinking a bunch about my biggest learnings from Kung-fu school: 
- I love having a schedule. 
  - Having walls to keep you on track, rather than veering into scrolling on social media, is super valuable. It keeps me happy.
- I can take way more pain than I think I can
  - One of Goggins' quotes is "most people quit at 40%", and it feels true.
- I'm horrendous at getting out of bed. 
  - A unmissable commitment is the only thing that works.
- I don't need to shower/eat breakfast before I do something
