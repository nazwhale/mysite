  For 3 months in Autumn 2016 I liven in a Kung-Fu School in Qufu, eastern
  Chinam, but never put down my reflections in writing. As a result, I probably
  haven't learnt as much from the experience as I could have. Here are those
  reflections.

I've also been thinking a bunch about my biggest learnings from Kung-fu school: 

### I love having a schedule. 
Having walls to keep you on track, rather than veering into scrolling on social media, is super valuable. It keeps me happy and makes me super present for the thing I'm scheduled to do.

### I can take way more pain than I think I can
David Goggins always says "most people quit at 40%". It feels true.

### I'm horrendous at getting out of bed. 
A unmissable commitment is the only thing that works.

### I don't need to shower/eat breakfast before I do something
