  People often ask me how to get started with coding. As I usually give the same
  answer, it made sense to crystalise it into some concrete steps.


  If anyone follows this, I'd love to hear how it goes.

Here's a saying we've all heard:

> How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time.

The number one question I get asked by people who want to start coding is "what language should I learn". It paralyses people. 

At this early stage you should optimise for learning. Forget about what's best paid or most in demand. \
\
Choosing something and getting going is a far optimal strategy to investing time up front to choose the "best" or "most in demand" language.\
\
This is because once you know one language, getting familiar with another is a relative doddle. In other words, it's easier to course correct once you understand the problem space a little better. Investing time on research up front when you know very little is an inefficient endeavour.

Here's how to take that first bite:

1. Choose a language 
2. Get set up
3. Find a course

Most people never get past 1 and spend a week on 2. You should aim to get through both in a couple of hours.
