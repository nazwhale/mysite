## what is this place?

I think the web is still in it's infancy and has scope to be pushed in interesting directions. I hope to use this site to explore that.

I've also included some of my scribbles in the Blog section.



## how'd ya make it?

This site is built with [Gatsby and Netlify CMS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/sourcing-from-netlify-cms/), which makes it speedy and easy to update. Have a poke around the code for it [if you like](https://github.com/nazwhale/mysite).



## who are you?

My name is Naz.

I'm a software engineer at [Monzo](https://www.monzo.com/), though I used to pretend to be a writer.

I live in London.
