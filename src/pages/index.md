## 



## what is this place?

At the moment this site is mainly for my personal programming excursions.



Things like exploring different designs, new ways of creating things, silly little diversions. In the future I'd like to hide lots of weird little easter eggs around it. Perhaps I already have?



I've also included some of my scribbles in the Blog section.



## how'd ya make it?

This site is built with Gatsby and Netlify CMS, which makes it speedy and easy to update. Have a poke around the code for it if you like.



I wanted a good width for reading, so I copied Medium.



## who are you?

My name is Naz.



I'm a software engineer at Monzo, though I used to pretend to be a writer.



I live in London.
